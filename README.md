# Art-Book

ArtBook is an app built merely with Core Data. The user can use this app to save the photos which she/he took with their name, artist, and year. The paintings I saved to the app have the exact name, artist and year. I benefited from Table View to construct the app. Also, I used UITapGestureRecognizer to select the images and to hide the keyboard. The user can add a new photo just by clicking the plus sign located right top corner and by filling the blank page appeared after clicking the plus sign. Thus, there are two View Controllers in this app and we can access each other by using segue. After saved the photo, it is saved to Core Data and even when the user terminated the app, if the user open it again, her/him selection is saved to the app. In addition, the user can delete the selected pictures just by swiping to left. You can see the details of my code by copying the app to Xcode.
